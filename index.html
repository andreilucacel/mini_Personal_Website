                  After completing the course, I gained a deep understanding of
                  key technological trends in deep learning. I learned how to
                  build, train, and apply fully connected neural networks,
                  implement efficient vectorized models, and identify crucial
                  architectural parameters, allowing me to apply deep learning
                  techniques to real-world applications.

                  By the end of the course, I became proficient in training and
                  developing test sets, analyzing bias and variance, and
                  applying techniques like L2 regularization, dropout,
                  hyperparameter tuning, and batch normalization. I also learned
                  to implement optimization algorithms such as mini-batch
                  gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop, and Adam, while
                  successfully building and deploying neural networks in
                  TensorFlow.
